/*
Write a method isLeapYear with a parameter of type int named year.
THe parameter needs to be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 9999
If the parameter is not in that range return false
Otherwise if it is in the valid range calculate if the year is a leap year and return true if it is, otherwise return false.
A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, but not by 100, or if it is divisible by 400.

Write another method getDaysInMonth with two parameters month and year, both type int.
if parameter month is < 1 or > 12 return -1
if parameter year is <1 or > 9999 return -1
The method needs to return the number of days in the month, be careful about leap years as they have 29 days in month 2.
